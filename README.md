# Minesweeper

Minesweeper game developed in C++, using the SFML library for GUI. Created as a hobby project to practice my programming ability. Contains all features a minesweeper game should contain apart from a "safe start", where the first click guarantees to hit a square with 0 neigbouring mines.
